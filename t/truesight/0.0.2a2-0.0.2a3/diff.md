-The TrueSight model is a hybrid forecasting tool that uses statistical forecasting models together with a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to make predictions. The TrueSight `Preprocessor` class is responsible for getting all the statistical forecasters in one place. It can handle forecasters from packages like `statsforecast`, `scikit-learn`, `pmdarima`, and others. You just need a class that accepts the `seasonal_length` parameter for the constructor and has a `.fit(x, y)` method

 All you need to do before using this package, is create a pandas dataframe with the following structure:
 
  - unique_id: A string that uniquely identifies each time series in the dataframe
  - ds: A datetime column with the date of each time step. The dates must be in the correct frequency for the date_freq parameter
  - y: The values of the time series
